# DesignCourse with React + NextJS Implementation

This is a GitHub repository for implementing CSS and HTML projects using React and NextJS frameworks, based on the tutorials from DesignCourse. The purpose of this repository is to showcase the projects I have created while learning CSS and web development using these frameworks.

## About DesignCourse

DesignCourse is an online learning platform that offers a wide range of tutorials and courses on web development, web design, and graphic design.

## About React and NextJS

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently. NextJS is a framework built on top of React that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and other useful features for building web applications.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have implemented using React and NextJS, based on the tutorials from DesignCourse:

* Project 1: A Simple Card

Each project has its own folder within this repository, containing the necessary files and instructions on how to run the application.

## Note

This repository is a work in progress, and I will continue to add more projects as I learn more about CSS and web development. I hope this repository will be useful for anyone who wants to learn how to implement CSS and HTML projects using React and NextJS.
